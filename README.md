## Development Process

### 1. **Frontend Development (React):**
The user interface was built using React components, including navigation, header, speciality menus, doctor listings, appointment booking forms, profile management, and appointment history. Tailwind CSS was used for styling and responsiveness.

### 2. **Backend Development (Node.js/Express):**
The backend API was developed using Express.js and Node.js.  Routes were created for user authentication, doctor management, appointment booking, and payment processing.

### 3. **Database Integration (MongoDB):**
MongoDB was used to store user data, doctor profiles, and appointment details. Mongoose was used for schema definition and database interaction.

### 4. **Image Management (Cloudinary):**
Cloudinary was integrated for storing and serving images.

### 5. **Payment Gateway Integration:**
   - Implemented Razorpay for secure online transactions.

### 6. **Authentication (JWT):**
JWT was implemented for secure user authentication and authorization.  Middleware was used to protect API routes.
